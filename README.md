# Devvortex-Writeup
A write-up of the Hack The Box devvortex machine for the TAMU Cybersecurity Club 

## Recon
`nmap` scan reveals that ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open. Additionally, the scan shows a redirect to `http://devvortex.htb/`

I add `devvortex.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file

## Site "devvortex.htb"
Visitng `http://devvortex.htb`, we are met with this site:

First, I look for `robots.txt`, but this site appears to not have one:

Second, I try to find anywhere on the site with user input, which is found in the "Contact Us" page of the website:

After filling in the fields with some fuzz input, like an apostrophe, it becomes clear that clicking "send" only refreshes the page and doesn't actually do anything.

With the "Contact Us" page leading nowhere, I begin to search for hidden directories using `gobuster`, which doesn't find anything out of the ordinary:

Next, still using `gobuster`, I search for any vhosts, which finds the domain, `dev.devvortex.htb`:

I add the domain to my `/etc/hosts` file:
